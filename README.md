# mini-profile
# Profile made using Tailwind.

This was my first project using the Tailwind library. It was my first project using a CSS framework and I wanted to start with a little profile I made it while following Kalob Taulien's class for his course. I tried making it responsive although I know that it's not completely responsive for tablet users (I had problems with the profile picture). 

This was an interesting project while trying to learn Web Developing.
